GETTING STARTED WITH Homer2_UI AND AtlasViewerGUI


============================================
Running Homer2_UI and AtlasViewerGUI from 
Matlab 
============================================

  1) Required Matlab toolboxes: 

     Homer2_UI
  
       Signal Processing Toolbox
       Symbolic Math Toolbox
  
  
     AtlasViewerGUI
  
       Image Processing Toolbox
       Simulink

  2) Doownload homer2 source code release file from the Homer2 web page
     on www.nitrc.org. Unzip the homer2 file. 

  3) Open Matlab and in the command window, change the current folder to 
     the homer2 root folder that you just downloaded and unzipped.

  4) In Matlab command window, type 

     >> setpaths
     
     This will set all the required matlab search paths for Homer2 and 
     AtlasViewer. 

     Note: this step should be done every time you start a new matlab session.
