# BA-Project: fNIRS Data Analysis

## Overview
This project is about the assessment of neuronal processing of degraded speech using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Aimed at uncovering the neural mechanisms underlying the comprehension of intelligible versus unintelligible speech, this study leverages advanced signal processing techniques and statistical analysis to analyze fNIRS data. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of speech processing in the brain, offering implications perhaps for both theoretical neuroscience and practical applications in speech therapy and rehabilitation.

## Objectives
- To evaluate how the human brain processes degraded speech at a neuronal level using fNIRS technology, since protable and non-invasive.
- To apply signal processing techniques and General Linear Model (GLM) analysis to discern patterns in neural activity.
- To distinguish between neural responses to intelligible and unintelligible speech, thereby identifying potential pathways involved in speech comprehension.

## Methodology
The project employs MNE-Python, a comprehensive library designed for analyzing neurophysiological data, alongside custom signal processing algorithms to assess fNIRS data. Our methodology encompasses:
- Preprocessing of fNIRS signals to remove noise and artifacts.
- Application of contrasting methods and GLM analysis to identify significant neural responses.
- Statistical analysis to validate findings and ensure reliability.

## Results
Our analysis revealed distinct neural processing patterns associated with the comprehension of intelligible versus unintelligible speech, for more details reach out to senior researcher at UZH: Dr. Daniel Friedrichs
